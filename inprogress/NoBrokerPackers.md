# No NoBroker!
## My experience with NoBroker
I booked for no broker packers and movers service a week in advance. They have an elaborate UI to fill in the 
details of all items that will be moved. Then I got an estimate and paid the advance amount to confirm the booking.

I kept getting notifications on email, SMS and whatsapp which created an illusion that everything is on track :)
I was expecting a call from the vendor if they could visit the site and check what needs to be moved so that they
can bring relevant packing material. This never happened, everything is virtual now!

Then a day before scheduled move, I got a call from NoBroker representative if my move date is confirmed. I confirmed
and also let them know that I have not yet received a call from the vendor. They said I'll get a callback within
2 minutes which I didn't.

My assumption was that I've given the accurate pickup location, the vendor will probably show up. Vendor didn't show up
30 minutes past scheduled time, I then reached out to NoBroker and they said their dashboards are not loading. I then
realized there's some link to call the vendor (which is not the vendor's phone but connected via nobroker system)

I reached out to vendor who claimed that he tried to reach out to me by calling me 25 times the day before to which
I replied did he message or reached out to NoBroker. For this they have no response, since they don't share my
phone number to vendor, they need to go through the nobroker system to reach which seems broken. I actually didn't
receive a single call, it looks to be the case that the number was detected as span and rejected.

NoBroker didn't reach out via whatsapp/sms/mail which they earlier used to send shiny messages with nice templates.
